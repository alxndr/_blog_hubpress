= my favorite way of changing code
:hp-tags: standards, communication, version control, commit messages, branching model

* git-flow. branching model 

* small atomic commits

* commit message structure... summary line; empty line; [optional] description/explanation/notes; empty line; [optional] ticket/bug identifier
** links are helpful.
*** _whenever_ you link to a line of code, _link to the code using a hash_ not the branch! (example...)
