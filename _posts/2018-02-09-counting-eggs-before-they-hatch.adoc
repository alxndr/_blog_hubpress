= counting eggs before they hatch

...not quite literally, because these wouldn't hatch anyway. But they are literal eggs. My housemates and I kept egg-laying chickens in our back yard for a couple years. Here's roughly how many the seven of them laid each day for four years:

Unfortunately in 2017 our neighbor's cat and the neighborhood raccoons had figured out how to get in to the coop. In January 2018 only one tough chicken had persisted through all the attacks, and we moved her to a nearby chicken retirement home with a better-built coop. Heidi is now free to live out the remainder of her seasons sans predators, laying an egg whenever she goddamn feels like it!
