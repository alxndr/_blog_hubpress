When you do a merge and there's a crazy conflict, you want to see what changed between the common ancestor and whatever you just pulled down. You can do that for individual files like this:

```
$ git ls-files -u | awk '{print $3" "$4}'
```

...to show what files are conflicting. It'll print out something like this:

```
1 path/to/file
2 path/to/file
3 path/to/file
```

...the `1` there is the common ancestor; `2` is your file (your HEAD); `3` is what you've tried to merge in. To see what changed between the common ancestor and what you just merged in, do this:

```
$ git diff :1:path/to/file :3:path/to/file
```
