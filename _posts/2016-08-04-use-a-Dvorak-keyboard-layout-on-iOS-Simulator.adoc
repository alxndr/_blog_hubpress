= use a Dvorak keyboard layout on iOS Simulator
:hp-tags: dvorak keyboard, ios

...why would anyone want to have Dvorak on a mobile device?!? Actually, I only care about it in the iOS *Simulator*, when I'm using it on a computer with a real-live hardware keyboard.

In OS X's Simulator (v9.3), go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Hardware Keyboard > English > Dvorak.

Ta-daa!
