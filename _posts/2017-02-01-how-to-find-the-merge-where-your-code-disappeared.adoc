= how to find the merge where your code disappeared

Because I keep forgetting that https://twitter.com/drwxrxrx/status/766373512437039104[I originally put this on the twitters]...

    git log --patch -m -G regexForMissingCode

(Neither of those short options have long names...)

About `-m`:

[quote, git help log]
-------
This flag makes the merge commits show the full diff like regular commits; for each merge parent, a separate log entry and diff is generated. An exception is that only diff against the first parent is shown when `--first-parent` option is given; in that case, the output represents the changes the merge brought into the then-current branch.

About `-G <regex>`:

[quote, git help log]
-------
Look for differences whose patch text contains added/removed lines that match `<regex>`. To illustrate the difference between `-S<regex> --pickaxe-regex` and `-G<regex>`, consider a commit with the following diff in the same file:
+    return !regexec(regexp, two->ptr, 1, &regmatch, 0);
...
-    hit = !regexec(regexp, mf2.ptr, 1, &regmatch, 0);
While `git log -G"regexec\(regexp"` will show this commit, `git log -S"regexec\(regexp" --pickaxe-regex` will not (because the number of occurrences of that string did not change). See the pickaxe entry in `gitdiffcore(7)` for more information.
